## Know Your ISM 
#### *College Grievance Redressal System*

Know Your ISM (KYI) is a set of multiple useful services we will list in the following few pages. These stem from one single cloud-based dataset of students, professors, officials,  workers, alums, locations and clubs across IIT (ISM) Dhanbad.
- ✨ KYI is like the MIS. But much faster, more extensive, more featured and vastly more accessible than the latter.
- ✨ So, the system comprises two components: the cloud service APIs and the client apps (on mobile and the web).
- ✨ The KYI mobile and web apps provide a control dashboard to access and use this dataset for multiple purposes that we list in the following pages.

### WHAT ARE WE SOLVING?
To provide a platform where students within the campus can post their grievances and authorities can take action to address them quickly.
The students face various issues in their day-to-day lives, such as adjustment issues, financial crises, mental distress, mess and hygiene-related issues, hostel maintenance issues, grievance redressal issues, etc. To tackle these issues, there is much need for a redress mechanism where students can post their problems.
